# Murderhouse

A real-time multiplayer Werewolf/Mafia game designed for "eyes open" gameplay. All night actions happen on private mobile devices or ESP32 physical terminals - no one closes their eyes. Supports 4-10 players.

## Quick Start

```bash
npm install
cd client && npm install
cd ../server && npm install
cd ..
npm run dev
```

Open in your browser:

- **Landing**: http://localhost:5173/
- **Host Dashboard**: http://localhost:5173/host
- **Big Screen**: http://localhost:5173/screen (projector/TV)
- **Players**: http://localhost:5173/player/1 through /player/10
- **Operator**: http://localhost:5173/operator (dead players send "messages from beyond" to living players)
- **Slide Editor**: http://localhost:5173/slides (dev: preview slides with mock data)
- **String Sheets**: http://localhost:5173/strings (dev: browse and override string catalog)

For production/remote deployment, `server/web.js` serves the built client over HTTP alongside the WebSocket server on a single port.

## How to Play

### Setup

1. Display big screen on projector/TV
2. Each player opens their player console on mobile
3. Host opens dashboard to control game flow
4. Start game when 4-10 players ready

### Day Phase

1. Players discuss and debate who to eliminate
2. Host initiates vote when ready
3. Players select target on their devices
4. Majority vote eliminates player (ties go to runoff, 3+ runoffs break randomly)

### Night Phase

1. Each role acts secretly on their device:
   - **Villager**: Suspect someone (tracking only)
   - **Alpha Werewolf**: Choose final kill target from pack suggestions
   - **Werewolf**: Suggest targets to the alpha
   - **Seer**: Investigate if someone is a werewolf
   - **Doctor**: Protect someone from death
   - **Vigilante**: One-time night kill (single use per game)
   - **Hunter**: Normal villager, but gets revenge kill when dying
   - **Governor**: Can pardon condemned players after a day vote
   - **Cupid**: Link two lovers at game start (if one dies, both die)
   - **Roleblocker**: Block one player's night ability
   - **Janitor**: Hide the victim's role when the pack kills
   - **Poisoner**: Replace the pack's kill with a delayed poison
   - **Drunk**: Believes they are a Seer; night action is randomly chosen
2. Host resolves events in priority order
3. Deaths revealed on big screen

### Win Conditions

- **Village wins**: All werewolves eliminated
- **Werewolves win**: Equal or outnumber villagers

| **Governor**    | Village  | —            | Can pardon a condemned player once per game                                                    |
| **Cupid**       | Village  | Link (setup) | Links two lovers at game start; heartbreak kills both                                          |
| **Tanner**      | Village  | Suspect      | Sees themselves as Villager; appears EVIL to the Seer (and Clue); wins with village            |
| **Drunk**       | Village  | Stumble      | Disguised as Seer; random action — investigate (accurate), kill/protect/block (shows INNOCENT) |
| **Alpha**       | Werewolf | Kill         | Final kill decision; promotes successor on death                                               |
| **Werewolf**    | Werewolf | Hunt         | Suggests targets to alpha; sees pack selections live                                           |
| **Roleblocker** | Werewolf | Block        | Blocks one player's night ability                                                              |
| **Janitor**     | Werewolf | Clean        | Hides victim's role reveal when the pack kills                                                 |
| **Poisoner**    | Werewolf | Poison       | Replaces pack kill with delayed poison (victim dies next night)                                |
| **Jester**      | Neutral  | —            | Wins solo if voted out by the village                                                          |

Role composition is defined per player count in `GAME_COMPOSITION` (see `server/definitions/roles.js`). The host can pre-assign roles; roles with `companions` (e.g. Cupid) automatically inject their companion into the pool, replacing a villager. Pre-assigned compositions are validated on game start to prevent invalid setups.

## Items

| Item          | Uses    | Effect                                                               |
| ------------- | ------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Pistol**    | 1       | Shoot a player during the day (player-initiated, instant resolution) |
| **Phone**     | 1       | Grants pardon ability (same as Governor, consumed on use)            |
| **Clue**      | 1       | Investigate a player (same as Seer)                                  |
| **Barricade** | 1       | Absorbs one kill; destroyed on use                                   |
| **Novote**    | 1       | Holder is excluded from the next vote                                |
| **Coward**    | passive | Cannot act at night; immune to night kills                           |
| **Tanned**    | passive | Appears EVIL to Seer and Clue investigations                         |
| **Prospect**  | passive | Joins the werewolf pack if killed by them                            |

Items are given by the host. Active items (`startsEvent`: pistol, clue) appear in the player's ability selector when idle. Items stack if the same type is given twice.

## Features

### Player Interface

- **UP/DOWN buttons**: Navigate targets/abilities
- **YES button**: Confirm selection (immutable once locked)
- **NO button**: Abstain from action (immutable once locked)
- **Icon column**: Right-edge display showing 18×18 abstract glyphs for role and inventory; scroll with dial/buttons when idle

### Physical Terminals

ESP32-based physical terminals can be used alongside or instead of mobile devices:

- **Dial** to select player ID (1-9) on boot
- **Rotary switch** navigates targets (same as UP/DOWN)
- **Arcade buttons** for YES/NO actions with LED feedback
- **OLED display** shows same 3-line game state as mobile
- **Multi-connection**: Web client and physical terminal can control the same player simultaneously

See `esp32-terminal/README.md` for hardware setup.

### Items & Custom Votes

- Host can give items or initiate custom votes at any time
- Custom votes can award items, change roles, or resurrect dead players
- Custom votes use the same runoff logic as standard day votes

### Governor Pardon

- After a vote eliminates a player, governor (or phone holder) can pardon
- Pardon is an interrupt flow that pauses normal resolution
- Governor role can pardon once per game; phone item is consumed on use

### Werewolf Pack

- Werewolves see each other's selections in real-time during hunt/kill events
- Pack hint shows the most popular target among living packmates (pluralizes dynamically)
- Alpha makes the final kill decision; non-alpha wolves suggest via the hunt event

### Event Timers

- Host can start a countdown timer on any active event
- Pushes a radial countdown slide to the big screen (depleting ring with participant gallery)
- When time expires the event force-resolves regardless of missing responses

### Big Screen

- Confirmed-player highlighting during active events
- Victory screen shows winner gallery with portraits
- Event timer slides with radial countdown animation

### Composition Validation

- Pre-assigned role compositions are validated on game start
- Blocks instant-win setups (e.g. all werewolves), duplicate alphas, and missing teams

### Three-Layer Game Logic

1. **Declarative Definitions** (`server/definitions/`) — Roles, events, and items are data-driven. Roles declare their team, event participation, passives, and win conditions. Events declare participants, targets, aggregation type, and resolution logic.

2. **State Machine** (`server/Game.js`) — Manages phase transitions (LOBBY → DAY ↔ NIGHT → GAME_OVER), event lifecycle (pending → active → resolved), death propagation with linked death cascades, win condition checks, and the slide queue for the big screen.

3. **Interrupt Flows** (`server/flows/`) — Complex multi-step mechanics that pause normal resolution. Each flow declares `static get hooks()` (e.g., `['onDeath']`, `['onVoteResolution']`) and `Game._checkFlows(hook, context)` dispatches to the matching flow. Resolution methods return structured result objects (`{ kills, slides, consumeItems, log }`) processed uniformly by `Game._executeFlowResult()` — flows never mutate Game state directly.

### Event Resolution Pipeline

1. Phase starts → `buildPendingEvents()` filters events with eligible participants
2. Host starts event → creates instance, sends prompts to participants
3. Players act → selections recorded; some events resolve immediately (shoot)
4. Host resolves → outcome computed, slides queued, deaths processed
5. Death cascade → `killPlayer()` queues deaths sequentially; each fires onDeath passives (hunter revenge, alpha promotion) then propagates linked deaths (cupid lovers)
6. Win check → runs after every kill and phase transition
7. Phase transition → clears all event state, advances day counter

### Event Priority Order

Events resolve by priority (lower = earlier): link (1) → block (5) → protect (10) → investigate (30) → stumble (30) → shoot (40) → customEvent (45) → vote (50) → hunt (55) → vigil (55) → clean (58) → poison (59) → kill (60) → suspect (80).

## Adding a Role

Checklist for adding a new role to the game:

1. **Constants** (`shared/constants.js`) — Add to `RoleId` enum, add to `AVAILABLE_ROLES`. If the role has a unique event, add to `EventId` too.
2. **Role definition** (`server/definitions/roles.js`) — Add role object with `id`, `name`, `team`, `description`, `color`, `emoji`, `tip`, `events`, and `passives`. Add to `GAME_COMPOSITION` for relevant player counts.
3. **Event definition** (`server/definitions/events.js`) — If the role has a unique event, add event with `id`, `phase`, `priority`, `participants`, `validTargets`, `aggregation`, `allowAbstain`, and `resolve`.
4. **Player model** (`server/Player.js`) — Add `EVENT_ACTIONS` entry for the new event (confirm/abstain/prompt labels). Add any new state flags (e.g. `isRoleblocked`) and reset them in `resetForPhase()` and `kill()`.
5. **Game engine** (`server/Game.js`) — Only needed if the role requires special resolution logic beyond what the event `resolve()` function handles.
6. **Icons** (`shared/icons.js` + `esp32-terminal/src/icons.h`) — Add 18x18 XBM bitmap, add to `Icons` map (JS) and `getIconBitmap()` (C++). Use identical byte data in both files.
7. **Client UI** (`client/src/components/EventPanel.jsx`) — Add to `availableRoles` array for the custom event modal.
8. **Docs** (`README.md`) — Update roles table, composition notes, and event priority order.

## Debug Mode

Enabled automatically outside production (`process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production'`). Set `NODE_ENV=production` to disable.

- Access `/debug` for 9-player grid view
- Auto-select buttons on host dashboard

## Testing

Server-only tests using [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/). See [`server/TESTING.md`](server/TESTING.md) for the full test framework design.

```bash
npm test              # Run all server tests once
npm run test:watch    # Watch mode (re-runs on file change)
```

## Known Technical Debt & Refactoring Opportunities

### Fixed

- ~~**String catalog coverage is incomplete on the server side**~~ — `server/strings.js` provides `str(cat, key, tokens)` reading from the shared `shared/strings/gameStrings.js` catalog with file-based overrides (`data/string-overrides.json`). All `addLog()` calls in `Game.js`, `events.js`, `flows/`, `roles.js`, and `handlers/index.js` now use `str()`.
- ~~**Most client pages still hardcode strings**~~ — `Host.jsx`, `Player.jsx`, `PlayerConsole.jsx`, and all slide components now read strings via `getStr()`. The string catalog has been moved to `shared/strings/gameStrings.js` so both client and server reference the same source.
- ~~**`Screen.jsx` is a 1200-line monolith**~~ — All 14 slide types extracted into individual components under `client/src/components/slides/`. `Screen.jsx` is now ~145 lines. A `/slides` dev tool at `/slides` lets you preview all slide types with mock data and edit strings live.
- ~~**`broadcastGameState()` called excessively**~~ — Schedules via `queueMicrotask()` with a `_broadcastScheduled` flag; multiple calls per synchronous handler now coalesce into one send.
- ~~**ABSTAINED state lost on fast event resolve**~~ — `player.syncState()` now called before `player.clearFromEvent()` in `resolveEvent` so `getActiveResult()` can read the null result and display ABSTAINED correctly.
- ~~**Dead WebSocket connections accumulate**~~ — Not an issue: `on('close')` in `server/index.js` already calls `player.removeConnection(ws)`.
- ~~**No error handling around file I/O**~~ — Read paths have try/catch with safe fallbacks; write failures are caught by the top-level handler try/catch in `handleMessage`.
- ~~**`DEBUG_MODE` hardcoded to `true`**~~ — Now reads `process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production'`; set `NODE_ENV=production` to disable debug routes and auto-select buttons.
- ~~**Host-auth check repeated 40+ times**~~ — Replaced with `requireHost(fn)` decorator in `server/handlers/index.js`; all 40 host handlers wrapped.
- ~~**No WebSocket reconnect backoff**~~ — Exponential backoff in `GameContext.jsx`: 2 s → 4 s → 8 s → 30 s max; resets to 2 s on successful reconnect.
- ~~**`resolveEvent()` does too much**~~ — Extracted into `_checkResponsesComplete`, `_applyRoleblocks`, `_cleanupParticipants`, `_commitResolution`, `_dispatchPrivateResults`; `resolveEvent` is now a ~20-line orchestration shell.
- ~~**Interrupt flows don't handle player disconnect**~~ — Added `onPlayerDisconnect(player)` hook to `InterruptFlow` base class. Hunter auto-resolves with a random target; Governor auto-executes when all governors disconnect. Wired via `game.notifyFlowsOfDisconnect()` called from `server/index.js` on last-connection close.
- ~~**No event definition validation**~~ — `_assertValidEventDef(event, eventId)` validates `resolve`, `participants`, `validTargets`, and `aggregation` at `startEvent()` time; throws with a clear message on misconfiguration.
- ~~**Duplicate event startup code**~~ — Extracted `_notifyEventParticipants()` shared by `startEvent`, `_startFlowEvent`, and `_startCustomEvent`; removed ~40 lines of duplication.
- ~~**Magic numbers in BPM colour function**~~ — Extracted `BPM_COLOR` constants in `slideUtils.js` with explanatory names.
- ~~**Flow result shape undocumented**~~ — Added `@typedef FlowResult` JSDoc at the top of `InterruptFlow.js` documenting all fields and their semantics.
- ~~**Item consumption rules are implicit**~~ — Documented `IMMEDIATE / ON_RESOLVE / ON_TRIGGER` consumption timing in `server/definitions/items.js` schema comment with concrete examples per item type.
- ~~**Win condition polling**~~ — `checkWinCondition()` now caches its result via a `Symbol` sentinel; cache invalidates on kill, revive, role change, and coward item give/remove. `removeItem()` promoted to a game-level method so removal always flows through a single invalidating path.
- ~~**Log broadcasting**~~ — Server `addLog()` broadcasts `LOG_APPEND` with a single entry array (instead of full log on every state change); client appends to local log state. Full `LOG` snapshot still sent on initial connect. Server trims log to 500 entries; client trims to 200.
- ~~**Terminal display flicker during target selection**~~ — ESP32 terminals now run a dedicated "fast path" loop during target selection that mirrors the SELECT TERMINAL boot screen: `inputPoll → render → delay → return`. The terminal takes full ownership of display state (`terminalOwnsDisplay` flag) and ignores all server messages until the player confirms or abstains. Server-side: `_executeBroadcast` skips terminal connections for players in target selection (`skipTerminalIfSelecting`); `player.send()` skips `GAME_STATE` and `EVENT_PROMPT` for all terminal connections (they never use these). Device MAC suffix shown on select screen (`1.0.1:XX`).

### Terminal fast path: known edge cases and future cleanup

- **Event resolves while player is scrolling** — If the event timer expires or all other players vote while the terminal is in the fast path, `terminalOwnsDisplay` stays true until the player presses YES/NO. The confirm/abstain will fail gracefully (event already resolved), ownership releases, and the next server state comes through. In practice this resolves instantly. A future improvement could add a server-initiated `EVENT_ENDED` message type that bypasses the guard.
- **Target list changes mid-selection** — If a player dies during a vote (e.g. shot by pistol), the terminal's cached `targetNames`/`targetIds` become stale. The player can still confirm; `confirmWithTarget` sends the explicit targetId which the server validates. Invalid targets are rejected server-side. A future improvement could accept target list updates without accepting selection state.
- **Pack hint updates blocked for wolf terminals** — During HUNT/KILL events, `broadcastPackState` sends to all cell members without `skipTerminalIfSelecting`. The `onDisplayUpdate` guard rejects these. Wolves on ESP32 terminals won't see real-time pack hint updates while scrolling, but will see the correct hint on the next full state update after confirming. Web clients are unaffected.
- **Idle scroll / action layer unaffected** — The fast path only activates when `terminalOwnsDisplay` is true (set when `targetCount > 0`). Idle item scrolling, action layer selection, and operator console all use the normal server-driven loop.

### Open

- **`Game.js` is a 3,300-line God Object** — Serves as state machine, event resolver, slide manager, persistence layer, and flow coordinator. Extract `EventResolver` (resolveEvent, skipEvent, resetEvent, flow handling), `SlideManager` (pushSlide variants, queue, auto-advance), and `PersistenceManager` (presets, scores, host settings) as separate classes.
- **`handlers/index.js` has 70+ handlers in one flat object** — No grouping by domain (player actions, host commands, debug). Extract into `PlayerActionsHandler`, `HostCommandsHandler`, `DebugHandler`. Add per-message payload validation middleware instead of duplicated `if (!player)` checks in every handler.
- **`Player.js` display logic is 400+ lines of tightly coupled methods** — 20+ `_display*` methods build display objects with repeated patterns. Extract a `DisplayStateBuilder` class with strategy/template pattern. Move `EVENT_ACTIONS` to `constants.js`.
- **`Host.jsx` manages 6 modals and 8+ state variables** — Extract `AutoAdvanceManager` hook (timer, pause/resume, slide queue tracking), `ModalManager` or modal context, and `MobileTabNavigator` component (swipe detection, tab switching).
- **`GameContext.jsx` has 30+ useState variables and a giant message switch** — Replace with `useReducer` grouped by domain. Extract `WebSocketManager` class for connection, reconnect, send logic. Extract message handlers into organized modules.
- **`network.cpp` hardcodes 142 operator words** — Baked in at compile time with no way to update. Move to `shared/operatorWords.js` and send from server on connection, or load from SPIFFS. Also needs JSON parse error handling — currently assumes server sends valid JSON.
- **`main.cpp` has nested state machines with scattered globals** — 10+ static state variables for connection, selection, heartbeat, encoder. Extract `TargetSelectionState`, `ResetGestureDetector`, and `TimerManager` as focused modules.
- **No linter or formatter configured** — No ESLint, no Prettier. 2-space indent convention is manual. Add config files and pre-commit hook.
- **No unit tests for core game logic** — `Game.js` event resolution, `Player.js` display state generation, and role definitions have no automated tests. Priority: event resolution priority ordering, death cascade correctness, display state priorities.
- **Magic numbers scattered across codebase** — Log trim at 500 entries, settle timer 150ms, heartbeat send 2s, debounce 120ms, keepalive 1s. Define named constants in `config.h` (ESP32) and `constants.js` (server).
- **Hardcoded color values in multiple files** — `Game.js` (`_getRoleAbilities`), `constants.js` (`ROLE_DISPLAY`, `ITEM_DISPLAY`). Extract to a shared `theme.js` palette.
- **`shared/strings/gameStrings.js` has no validation** — 319 entries in a flat array with no check that `tokens` match `{placeholder}` usage in `default`, no unused string detection, and inconsistent key nesting depth. Add a `StringCatalogValidator` and audit tool.
- **No structured logging** — Server uses `console.log` with manual prefix markers (`[Server]`, `[WS]`). No log levels. Add a lightweight logger with info/warn/error levels.
