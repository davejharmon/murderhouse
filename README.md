# Murderhouse

A real-time multiplayer Werewolf/Mafia game designed for "eyes open" gameplay - no one needs to close their eyes during night phases, as all actions are performed on private mobile devices.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install
cd client && npm install
cd ../server && npm install
cd ..

# Run development mode (server + client)
npm run dev
```

Open in your browser:

- **Landing Page**: http://localhost:5173/
- **Host Dashboard**: http://localhost:5173/host
- **Big Screen** (projector): http://localhost:5173/screen
- **Player Consoles**: http://localhost:5173/player/1 through /player/9
- **Debug Grid** (9-player testing): http://localhost:5173/debug

**Debug Mode**: Set `DEBUG_MODE = true` in `shared/constants.js` to enable:
- `/debug` route with 9-player grid view for easy testing
- 🎲 Auto-select buttons on host dashboard to randomize uncommitted selections

## Design Principles

### Declarative Game Rules

Roles and events are defined declaratively in `/server/definitions/`. To add a new role:

```javascript
// server/definitions/roles.js
export const roles = {
  myNewRole: {
    id: 'myNewRole',
    name: 'My New Role',
    team: Team.VILLAGE,
    description: 'Description shown to player',
    color: '#hex',
    events: {
      vote: {}, // Participates in voting
      myCustomEvent: {
        priority: 30, // Lower = resolves earlier
        canTarget: (player, target, game) => true,
        onResolve: (player, target, game) => ({ success: true }),
      },
    },
    passives: {
      onDeath: (player, killer, game) => {
        /* triggered when killed */
      },
    },
  },
};
```

### Event Resolution Order

Events resolve in priority order (lower number = earlier):

1. **protect** (10) - Doctor's protection
2. **investigate** (30) - Seer's investigation
3. **shoot** (40) - Use pistol item to kill
4. **customVote** (45) - Host-initiated custom vote with rewards
5. **vote** (50) - Day elimination vote
6. **kill** (60) - Werewolf attack
7. **suspect** (80) - Villager suspicion tracking

### Player Interface

Players use a unified YES/NO interface:

- **UP/DOWN buttons** (or swipe) to navigate through targets or abilities
- **YES button** to confirm selection (immutable - no changing after)
- **NO button** to abstain from event (also immutable)
- When idle with items, swipe through abilities and press YES to activate

The "tiny screen" shows contextual information based on game state and selections.

## Inventory System

Players can receive items that grant special abilities:

- **Items** are added to player inventory by the host or through game events
- **Stackable Items**: Multiple copies of the same item add additional uses
- **Usage**: Items with actions create new events that players can participate in

### Available Items

| Item   | Uses | Description                                    |
| ------ | ---- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Pistol | 1    | Shoot another player during DAY phase          |

### Item Events

- **shoot** (priority 40): Player-initiated and player-resolved. Immediate slides on selection (DRAW → GUNSHOT/NO SHOTS FIRED)

## Custom Votes

The host can initiate custom votes during DAY phase with configurable rewards:

- **Item Reward**: Vote for who receives an item (e.g., pistol)
- **Role Reassignment**: Vote to change someone's role
- **Resurrection**: Vote to bring a dead player back to life

### Voting Mechanics

- **Runoff System**: Ties trigger a runoff vote with only tied candidates as valid targets
- **Up to 3 Runoffs**: After 3 runoffs, winner is randomly selected from frontrunners
- **Tally Slides**: Vote results show tally first, then resolution (prevents spoilers)
- **Self-Voting**: Players can vote for themselves in item/role votes (not resurrection)

## Game Flow

### Lobby

1. Players join via `/player/1` through `/player/9`
2. Host connects at `/host`
3. Big screen displays at `/screen`
4. Host clicks "Start Game" when 4-9 players are ready

### Day Phase

1. Players discuss (verbally, in-person)
2. Host can start custom votes (optional) or items may trigger events
3. Host starts "vote" event for elimination
4. Players select targets on their devices
5. Host resolves vote - tally slide shows vote counts
6. Host advances to result slide - majority is eliminated, role revealed on big screen
7. Ties trigger runoff votes with only tied candidates as options

### Night Phase

1. Host advances to night
2. Host starts all events (protect, investigate, kill, suspect)
3. Each role acts on their private device
4. Host resolves events in priority order
5. Results shown (deaths, but not who did what)

### Win Conditions

- **Village wins**: All werewolves eliminated
- **Werewolves win**: Werewolves equal or outnumber villagers

## Roles

| Role     | Team     | Night Action                                    |
| -------- | -------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Villager | Village  | Suspect (track who you think is evil)           |
| Werewolf | Werewolf | Kill (vote with other wolves)                   |
| Seer     | Village  | Investigate (learn if target is evil)           |
| Doctor   | Village  | Protect (save someone from death)               |
| Hunter   | Village  | Revenge (kill someone when you die)             |
| Cupid    | Village  | Link (bind two players - if one dies, both die) |

### Role Distribution

| Players | Composition                                           |
| ------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| 4       | 1 werewolf, 1 seer, 2 villagers                       |
| 5       | 1 werewolf, 1 seer, 3 villagers                       |
| 6       | 1 werewolf, 1 seer, 1 doctor, 3 villagers             |
| 7       | 2 werewolves, 1 seer, 1 doctor, 3 villagers           |
| 8       | 2 werewolves, 1 seer, 1 doctor, 4 villagers           |
| 9       | 2 werewolves, 1 seer, 1 doctor, 1 hunter, 4 villagers |

## Extending the Game

### Adding a New Event

```javascript
// server/definitions/events.js
export const events = {
  myEvent: {
    id: 'myEvent',
    name: 'My Event',
    description: 'Shown to participants',
    phase: [GamePhase.NIGHT],
    priority: 40,

    playerInitiated: false, // true = event triggered by player (not shown in host's pending events)
    playerResolved: false,  // true = auto-resolves when player acts (host sees SKIP button)

    participants: (game) =>
      game.getAlivePlayers().filter((p) => p.role.id === 'myRole'),
    validTargets: (actor, game) =>
      game.getAlivePlayers().filter((p) => p.id !== actor.id),

    aggregation: 'individual', // or 'majority'
    allowAbstain: true,

    // Optional: Execute immediately when player makes selection
    onSelection: (actorId, targetId, game) => {
      // targetId is null if player abstained
      // Return { slide: {...}, message: '...' }
    },

    resolve: (results, game) => {
      // results = { playerId: targetId, ... }
      // Return { success: true, slide: {...}, message: '...' }
    },
  },
};
```

### Adding a New Passive

Passives are triggered by game events:

```javascript
passives: {
  onDeath: (player, killer, game) => {
    // Triggered when this player dies
    // Return { interrupt: true } to pause for player action
  },
  onNightStart: (player, game) => {
    // Triggered at start of each night
  },
  onDayStart: (player, game) => {
    // Triggered at start of each day
  },
}
```

### Adding a New Item

```javascript
// server/definitions/items.js
export const items = {
  myItem: {
    id: 'myItem',
    name: 'My Item',
    description: 'What this item does',
    maxUses: 1, // -1 for unlimited uses
    eventId: 'myItemEvent', // Optional: Event triggered when used
  },
};
```

Items are added to player inventory via `game.giveItem(playerId, itemId)`. If the item has an `eventId`, it creates a pending event when added.

## Technical Notes

### WebSocket Protocol

Messages follow the format: `{ type: string, payload: object }`

**Client → Server:**

- `join` - Join as player
- `selectUp` / `selectDown` - Navigate targets
- `confirm` / `abstain` - Lock in selection or abstain
- `useItem` - Activate item ability
- `hostConnect` / `screenConnect` - Connect as host/screen
- `startGame`, `nextPhase`, `resetGame` - Game control
- `startEvent`, `resolveEvent`, `skipEvent`, `startAllEvents`, `resolveAllEvents` - Event management
- `startCustomVote` - Start custom vote with config (rewardType, rewardParam, description)
- `giveItem`, `removeItem` - Inventory management
- `killPlayer`, `revivePlayer`, `kickPlayer` - Player management
- `nextSlide`, `prevSlide`, `clearSlides` - Slide control
- `debugAutoSelect`, `debugAutoSelectAll` - Debug helpers (only when DEBUG_MODE enabled)

**Server → Client:**

- `gameState` - Full game state update
- `playerState` - Private player state (for host and individual players)
- `slide` - Current slide for big screen
- `eventPrompt` - Event details for participant
- `eventResult` - Private result (e.g., seer investigation)

### State Management

React context (`GameContext`) manages all WebSocket communication and state. Components subscribe to the context and receive updates automatically.

### Styling

CSS Modules:

- Dark backgrounds (#0a0c0f, #141820)
- IBM Plex Mono for headings/UI
- IBM Plex Sans for body text
- Accent colors for roles and status indicators
